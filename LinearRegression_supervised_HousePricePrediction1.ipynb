The goal is to find a linear equation that best describes how the house price changes as the features change. For example, we might try to predict house price based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",

        "*   **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
        "*   **Independence of Errors:** The errors (the difference between the actual and predicted house prices) are independent of each other.\n",
        "*   **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",

        "### Linear Independence\n",
        "\n",
        "The assumption of linear independence, or the absence of multicollinearity, is crucial. It means that no independent variable can be perfectly predicted from a linear combination of the other independent variables. When independent variables are highly correlated, it can be difficult for the model to determine the individual effect of each variable on the dependent variable (house price).\n",

        "**Bad Example of Non-Linear Relationship or Violation of Linear Independence:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **House Age:** The relationship between house age and price might not be strictly linear. Very old houses might be more valuable due to historical significance, while slightly older houses might be less valuable than new ones. This could represent a non-linear relationship.\n",
        "*   **Multicollinearity Example:** If you include both the number of bedrooms and the number of bathrooms as independent variables, and these two features are highly correlated (e.g., houses with more bedrooms almost always have more bathrooms), this would be an example of multicollinearity, violating the linear independence assumption. It becomes difficult to isolate the impact of bedrooms versus bathrooms on the price."

        "## Model Performance and Parameter Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The bar plot above visualizes the coefficients of the linear regression model trained to predict house prices. Each bar represents a feature (independent variable) from the dataset, and the height of the bar indicates the magnitude and sign of its corresponding coefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **coefficient** for a feature represents the estimated change in the predicted house price for a one-unit increase in that feature, *assuming all other features are held constant*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's interpret the coefficients from the plot:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **SquareFeet:** This feature has the largest positive coefficient. This means that, according to the model, for every one-unit increase in square footage (holding other factors like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and age constant), the house price is expected to increase by approximately the value of its coefficient (around 200). This aligns with the general understanding that larger houses tend to be more expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **NumberOfBedrooms:** This feature has the second largest positive coefficient. A one-unit increase in the number of bedrooms, while keeping other features the same, is associated with a significant increase in the predicted price (around 34000).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **NumberOfBathrooms:** Similar to bedrooms, the number of bathrooms also has a substantial positive coefficient (around 21000). This suggests that adding a bathroom, everything else being equal, is expected to increase the house price significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **HouseAge:** This feature has the smallest positive coefficient (around 110). This indicates that for each additional year of age, the predicted house price is expected to increase slightly, holding other features constant. This might seem counterintuitive as older houses can sometimes be less valuable, but it reflects the linear relationship the model found in this specific dataset. It's important to remember that linear regression assumes a linear relationship, and if the true relationship is non-linear (as we introduced in the data generation), the linear model will only capture the best linear approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Insights from the Visualization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The bar plot clearly shows the relative importance of each feature in determining the predicted house price according to this linear model.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **SquareFeet** has the most substantial positive impact on price, followed by **NumberOfBedrooms** and **NumberOfBathrooms**.\n",
        "*   **HouseAge** has a much smaller positive impact compared to the other features.\n",
        "\n",
        "This visualization provides a quick and intuitive way to understand which features the model considers most influential in predicting house prices and the direction of their influence (positive or negative impact on price). However, it's crucial to remember that these are model estimates based on the provided data and assume linear relationships and independence between features."
